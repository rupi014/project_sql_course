# University SQL Database Project

This project involves creating a SQL database for a university, including tables for Students, Courses, Professors, and Grades with appropriate foreign key relationships. 
A script will populate the database with sample data. 
SQL queries will be developed to calculate average grades, identify top students, sort students by courses, generate course difficulty reports, and find student-professor course overlaps.
